# RÃ¶SeNa App

This project is built using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Development

### Angular App

Run `ng serve` to start the Angular dev server. It will serve the app on [localhost](http://localhost:4200/).

### Cloud Functions

In theory these can be run locally in a a dev environment with the [firebase emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup), but this project was built without them.

## Build

Running `firebase deploy` in the root directory of the repo will automatically build and deploy the entire project. For this firebase-tools need to be installed globally and you have to be logged into your google account.

### Angular App

By running `npm build:prod` in the hosting directory the Angular app will be built. This step also automatically puts the current version number into the environment file of the app. Because this step is not repeatable the environment file with the inserted version number should never be comitted. The build can also be done by running `ng build` with the optional `--prod` flag.

### Cloud Functions

The functions are a standard TypeScript project built with `tsc` or just with `npm run build` in the `functions` directory.

## Running unit tests

Unit tests of the Angular app can be run in two ways:

- with live reloading and the HTML report by running `ng test`
- headless with `npm run test:ci` for running tests in ci

## Running end-to-end tests

End to end test are not yet implemented but would be run with `ng e2e`.
