# TODO

## navigation

- move navigation elements near the router outlets
- work with routerLinks and routerLinkActive to reduce big amounts of code
- move the second layer of navigation to the side of the page (some kind of box)

## Help-Page

- add how to contact someone when:
  - a page is missing or a link is broken
- what to do when you forgot your password

## Database

- change db collection names? persons may not fit very well
- remove document links when deleting the document itself (remove person from events when person gets deleted)

## Login

- add "this site uses cookies" popup

### Ideas

- separate user into "authority groups"
  - level 5 = admin
  - level 4 = presidency
  - level 3 = group leaders
  - level 2 = members
  - level 1 = guest
