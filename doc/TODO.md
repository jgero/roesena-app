# TODO

## Help-Page

- add how to contact someone when:
  - a page is missing or a link is broken
- what to do when you forgot your password

## Database

- change db collection names? persons may not fit very well

## Login

- check cookies on API requests
- add "this site uses cookies" popup
- then after login directly navigate back to the page he came from
- think of good way to check authentication
- especially for adding elements

### Ideas

- separate user into "authority groups"
  - level 5 = admin
  - level 4 = presidency
  - level 3 = group leaders
  - level 2 = members
  - level 1 = guest
- then comparisons for access allowance should be done before providing data!
